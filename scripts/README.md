# scripts

- These files are important scripts releated to sparkle stats. Each subdirectory contains it's own README describing the scripts within.
- A lot of the scripts reference specific Janelia filesystems, so they will most likely break outside of Janelia's network. They can still be used as examples for how to interact with sparkle stats. 
  - The scripts should work fine for anyone with access to Funke Lab drives
  - The `sparkle_stats` package should work fine for anyone even if they do not have access to the Janelia filesystem
